You've got the right idea, but let me refine it a bit to clarify the process:

1. **Client Sends Access Token**: For each API request, the client sends the access token in the Authorization header to authenticate.
2. **If Access Token Expires**: If the access token has expired, the server will return an unauthorized response (e.g., `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`).
3. **Client Uses Refresh Token**: When the client receives this response, it will then send a request to the refresh endpoint with the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
4. **Server Validates Refresh Token**: The server validates the refresh token. If it's valid, the server generates a new access token and optionally a new refresh token.
5. **Client Receives New Tokens**: The client receives the new access token (and possibly a new refresh token) and can now retry the original request with the new access token.

Here's the refined flow:

1. **Client sends an API request with an access token**.
2. **Server validates the access token**:
    - **If valid**, processes the request.
    - **If expired**, returns an unauthorized response.
3. **Client detects the access token expiration**:
    - Sends a request to the refresh endpoint with the refresh token.
4. **Server validates the refresh token**:
    - **If valid**, generates and returns a new access token (and optionally a new refresh token).
    - **If invalid**, returns an unauthorized response.
5. **Client receives the new access token**:
    - Retries the original request with the new access token.

This approach ensures that access tokens are short-lived for security while allowing the refresh token to provide a seamless user experience by obtaining new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
